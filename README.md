## Introduction

Open Source Web Components is a community-driven project aimed at providing a library of reusable, customizable web components. Our goal is to create a learning environment for beginners while also building a valuable resource for developers of all skill levels.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A modern web browser that supports Web Components (most up-to-date browsers do)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JohnDev19/open-source-web-components.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd open-source-web-components
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the component showcase.

### Adding New Web Components

To add new web components to the project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `template.html` file from the root directory:
   ```sh
   cp template.html components/your-component-name.html
   ```

2. Rename `your-component-name.html` to a unique name that describes your component.

3. Add your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the new component within this file. Ensure your CSS and JavaScript are directly included in the template file for ease of use.

4. If your component uses images, add them to the appropriate directory within `assets` (e.g., `assets/buttons/buttons-img` for button images) and reference them appropriately in your HTML.
